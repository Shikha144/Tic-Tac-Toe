Tic Tac Toe is a classic 2-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid with X or O. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

This project demonstrates:

Core web development skills (HTML, CSS, JS)

DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript

Basic game logic and state management

It’s an ideal beginner-friendly project to showcase coding fundamentals.

🔹 Features
✅ Two-player mode (on the same device)

✅ Win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)

✅ Draw detection

✅ Reset game button

✅ Highlight winning combination

🔹 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

🔹 Game Logic Overview
Players click on empty squares to place their mark (X or O).

JavaScript checks after every move if there is a winner using predefined winning patterns.

If a player wins, the winning combination is highlighted and the game stops.

If all squares are filled with no winner, the game declares a draw.

Players can click “Reset” to start a new game.
